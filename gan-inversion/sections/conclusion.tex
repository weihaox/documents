\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
Deep generative models such as GANs learn to model a rich set of semantic and physical rules about the target distribution by generating the data. 
GAN inversion reveals the rules encoded in the network, or how a rule could be exploited to manipulate images. 
In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of GAN inversion methods with an emphasis on algorithms and applications. 
We summarize the important features of GAN latent space and models, and then introduce four kinds of GAN inversion methods and their key characteristics. 
We then introduce several fascinating applications of GAN inversion, including image manipulation, image restoration, image interpolation, style transfer, and compressive sensing.
Lastly we discuss some challenges and future directions for GAN inversion, and we hope this paper would inspire future research to solve them.
