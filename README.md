# documents

This repo stores some latex source templates.

- `ganinversion`: GAN Inversion: A Survey.
- `poster`
-- `interpGaze`: includes the poster of our MM'20 paper.
- `research statement`: contains the research statement.
- `bibliography`: houses the master bibliography file that I use for my academic research without the frustration of having to repeatedly search and download bib entries (and subsequently correct) or copy-paste from prior projects in every research project I work on.
